# How to Contribute

Thanks for considering to contribute to this project! Here are some guidelines for any contributions to this project.

## Documentation

For documentation, be sure to be as systematic and unambiguous as possible. In terms of styling, refer to existing documentation for the level of detail or instructions required.

## Developing

To get set up, consult the relevant READMEs for the [backend](../bdlist-backend/README.md) or [frontend](../bdlist-frontend/README.md).

## Issues

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/shuttleday/shuttleday/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue template.

## Submitting Changes

Fork the repository and make the changes in your own repository.

Then, please open a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/shuttleday/shuttleday/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done and what it aims to contribute.

Refer to the [Coding conventions](#coding-conventions) if you are contributing code.

## Commit Conventions

One change should be mapped to one commit. Try not to lump too many changes into a single commit.

We use [Angular Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) for our git commit messages.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "fix: add sh directive
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
